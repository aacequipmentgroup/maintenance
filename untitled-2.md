# Summary

* This document provides guidance around the consideration and setting of appropriate maintenance schedules, but should not be considered to have any legal or official standing.
* It is suggested that powered communication aids are maintained following the guidance relevant to medical devices, even where devices have not been placed on the market as such.
* Managing Medical Devices is suggested as the main relevant guidance to which services should refer. 
* Electrical safety testing is a key component of PPM of powered communication aids.  
* The Code of Practice for in-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment by The Institution of Engineering and Technology is the main relevant guidance on electrical safety testing to which services should refer.
* Visual and functional testing are also required components of PPM and a PPM visit should not simply consist of a PAT test.
* Each installation should have a defined PPM schedule, the period for this schedule should be based on a range of factors including: manufacturers guidance,  device, client and environment specific factors.
* Each PPM schedule should consider the specific risks of the installation, including the specific communication aid, the situation of the client, and the environment in which it is installed.
* Manufacturer's instructions should inform the PPM schedule, but it is likely that for powered communication aids these will not provide any indication around PPM schedules.
* A schedule of 12 monthly PPM is often used as a default PPM period, however this period should still be risk based and a shortened or longer schedule can be appropriate.
* Staff should be appropriately trained and competent to carry out PPM visits to clients.  
* Staff registered as Clinical Technologists or Healthcare Science Practitioners should have job roles that are appropriate for carrying out PPM
* Services should have staff carrying out these roles supervised by a registered Clinical Technologist, Clinical Scientist or equivalent.
