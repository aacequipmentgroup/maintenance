# PPM Considerations

The following section provides guidance around the consideration and setting of appropriate maintenance schedules. The aim of this section includes referencing possible appropriate guidance or legislation that relates to the planned maintenance of communication aid equipment. This is not an exhaustive list and should not be assumed to be complete.

Although not all powered communication aids placed on the market by manufacturers are classified as Medical Devices, in terms of equipment management and maintenance it may be appropriate to manage powered communication aids as if they were classified as Medical Devices.

As a minimum services should keep copies of and be familiar with the contents of the following documents:

1. Managing Medical Devices – Guidance for healthcare and social services organisations, MHRA April 2005. Particular attention to be paid to section 8 Maintenance and Repair.

A range of Legislation will apply to the process of and activities involved in PPM. As part of the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, manufacturers should provide instructions on maintenance and servicing of products placed on the market.

The law states that electrical equipment that could cause danger should be maintained, but does not say how often. The frequency of testing should be determined after referring to the instructions provided by the manufacturer \(if any\), and the guidance listed above.

Risk assessment could be used to help identify any uncertainty around safety. You could use the risk assessment protocol used by your organisations, or refer to BS EN ISO 14971:2012 Medical devices. Application of risk management to medical devices. The Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine \(IPEM\) have produced a document Risk Management and its Application to Medical Device Management \(2007\).

## Electrical Safety Testing

The Managing Medical Devices document provides an outline of a healthcare organisation’s responsibilities regarding electrical safety testing. In particular:

> there is no specific legal obligation, or even guidance, requiring healthcare organisations to carry out any particular test, but there is a general duty to take necessary steps to protect staff and patients from danger.

The Health and Safety at Work Act states:

* The provision and maintenance of plant and systems of work that are so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health.
* The provision of such information, instruction, training and supervision, as necessary.

In the Electricity at Work Act states:

* No electrical equipment shall be put into use where its strength and capability may be exceeded in such a way as may give rise to danger.
* All systems shall be maintained so as to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, such danger.

As a minimum, an electrical safety test will be a visual inspection of the device. Depending on the level of use and level of risk, this may also include a Portable Appliance Test \(PAT\).
