# Withdrawing Equipment/Maintenance

Equipment will be withdrawn when it is no longer used by the client; however there are some circumstances where PPM may also be withdrawn by a service.

Issue documentation should make the responsibilities of the client and of the service clear with relation to withdrawal of equipment and of maintenance. This documentation should also provide the client with details for contacting the service in the event of no longer needing the equipment.

In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to remove the provision of PPM from an installation. Such circumstances may include \(but are not limited to\):

* Being unable to access the installation to maintain it \(given reasonable efforts\).
* The equipment installed has been abused/ damaged. 

In this case, notice that PPM is being withdrawn may be given by the service. Before PPM is withdrawn, it is suggested that the service:

* Attempts to contact the client by all reasonable methods. This may include physically visiting the property, if the client is informed that this may happen by letter. 
* Checks any changes in contact details via local professionals, national records etc. 
* Sends a notification to inform the client of the intention to provide notice. Leaving a reasonable response period \(e.g 4 weeks\). 
* Sends a letter, by recorded delivery, to inform the client of the withdrawal of maintenance and the consequences of this. 
* Attempts to physically withdraw equipment by attending the site.
