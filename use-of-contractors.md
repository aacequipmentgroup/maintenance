# Use of Contractors

Managing Medical Devices advises that 3rd party service providers should comply with relevant quality standards such as BN EN ISO 13485:2012 or BS EN ISO 9001:2008. It also comments that any contract with a 3rd party service provider should specify the level and type of service required. The NHS Supply Chain Contract \(Electronic Assistive Technology:2014, updated for 2018\) specifies the requirements of contractors providing powered communication aids and also the requirements of contractors supplying associated servicing, including PPM.

A service contracting the PPM of powered communication aids should ensure the contractor performs to the same, or superior, standards to those above and described within this document. The service is should ensuring these standards are met by the contractor including by reviewing contractors' activity and audit.
