# Visit Procedures

A PPM visit will include some elements of all of the sections covered below \(depending on what equipment is installed\). 

## Visit Preparation

Configuration and setup files and settings records should be checked for each PPM installation and copies of these available at the PPM visit.  Any settings or configuration files should be backed up at all visits and records updated.

Photographs of the original installation \(e.g device mounted on to chair\) should be retrieved for each PPM visit so that these can be reviewed during the visit. 

## Visual Inspection

All of the equipment on the Loan Inventory should be visually inspected as a routine part of the PPM.  Visual inspection should not just involve looking - it will normally involve picking up and moving equipment to check all sides of equipment.   

Visual inspection will involve looking for damage to casing, fraying of cables, wiring is correct/unaltered, fuse is correct, wear and tear on moving parts beyond tolerance; damage to seals; and other checks. In general, any sign of wear or damage should be investigated carefully.

If any of the equipment is missing this should be documented, a decision made about whether to replace this equipment must be made and the relevant escalation procedure for missing equipment carried out.

If any of the equipment is found to be damaged in any way, it may be possible to repair the damage if this is not possible it may be necessary to remove the equipment and for it to be replaced as soon as possible. If damage is not considered to have any safety implications it may be decided to just note the damage. This decision should be backed up by a risk assessment  \(referring to the original risk assessment\) and should be recorded in the PPM records.

The results of the visual inspection must be noted on the PPM records.

## Mechanical Safety Testing and Device Mounting

Where mechanical elements such as a mounting system have been issued to a client, these should be checked to ensure that they are still functioning correctly, being used as intended and that the client and their support team have the required knowledge and skills to use them safely and effectively.

Checks of equipment should include both visual inspection and, where appropriate, manual and functional testing. Inspection should compare the current configuration with reference photos of the original installation –and thus there should be a procedure for obtaining these photographs at the initial installation.

Mounting assemblies should be carefully tested, manual and force testing should be used to ensure that there is no unexpected or unwanted movement within the mounting system. All locking mechanisms and mechanisms designed as stops/limiters should be checked as functioning as intended and any changes which may impact on the stability of the device and mounting should be checked for. 

Where changes in seating system or significant changes in client’s presentation have occurred this should be considered in the same way as a new installation and local procedures for escalating this should be carried out. 

## Electrical Safety Testing

Powered communication aids typically use external power supplies and are classified as Class II devices. Class II devices can be identified by the following symbol on the power supply housing:

![Symbol used to indicate a device is double insulated.](.gitbook/assets/double-insulated-image.png)

If this symbol is not present on the charger, you should assume it is a Class I electrical device.

The IET defines electrical devices as one of six types. The most relevant types for AAC devices are:

* IT – Information Technology equipment
* M – Movable equipment
* P – Portable equipment
* H – Hand Held Equipment

These definitions are provided in section 5 of the IET Code of Practice. Devices are likely to be defined as portable as they are easily used from one place to another \(between wheelchairs or a desk/bed\). A device could be defined as Movable if it used primarily in one location, and not moved between rooms in the environments such as a device used solely on a floor stand. A mobile phone or small tablet could be classed as Hand Held.

The visual inspection, as described above, should be carried out before an electrical load test is carried out on the device. Most powered communication aids will require either a Portable Appliance Test, or Medical Device Test using a medical grade \(and calibrated\) tester.

## Portable Appliance Test

The instructions provided with the PAT tester should be followed to carry out the test.

Services should use form V.2 from the Code of Practice to document visual and combined inspection test result. A device register should be maintained either using the organisation’s asset management system, software provided with the PAT tester or using the form provided in the IET Code of Practice.

The PAT test will test \(depending on the class of the device\) the Earth resistance, Earth Continuity, Insulation Resistance and Polarity. All relevant parts of an installation should be tested \(including cables\). 

The overall components of the electrical testing would include:

* Establishing the device category
* Test accordingly
* Label with next test date due or do not use after date
* Record findings
* Take out of service defective equipment

## Repairs and Modifications

The ability of staff to identify and carry out repairs, adjust access settings and device mounting etc on-site, depends on their level of training. Staff should work within their level of competency and may have to report the required changes to more senior staff rather than implementing them during the maintenance visit. Please refer to the section on Staffing above for further guidance.

The need for repairs will be identified during PPM visits. A RAG rating \(Red, Amber, Green\) can be used to classify the repair:

* Red - items needing immediate repair \(i.e. damage poses risk to client or device non-functional until repairs effected\).
* AMBER - items that need remedial attention but are not a risk and system is still functional \(i.e. device can continue to be used but items need repairing/ replacing in next 4 weeks\). Agree timescale for repair/ replacement at the visit.
* GREEN – all OK.

The cause of damage should be discussed with the client and a risk evaluation and assessment should be carried out as appropriate.  The aim is to reduce the risk of further damage. 

In some cases, this may lead to removal of the equipment until a case review/ risk assessment can be completed and a plan agreed and put in place for each environment. Dependent on "withdrawal of equipment" guidance - in some circumstances e.g. repeated deliberate damage - device may be withdrawn. 

Preventative Repairs may be considered, these are repairs that aim to extend the life span of the device and to reduce the likelihood of known issues/ 'user error'. These may include the use of: sacrificial connectors; cable restraint; or switch plug blanking.

Where a repair is required, the manufacturer’s user instructions should be referred to. They may recommend that repairs are completed by the OEM, and that only OEM-approved components should be used.

While requests for modifications may be raised at the PPM visit, most changes to the set-up of the system must be agreed subsequently as part of a clinical review of the system and agreed with all relevant parties present \(e.g. the user/ carers/ local team/ specialist service etc\).  It is not expected that significant changes to any aspect of an installation would be made at a PPM visit.  However, minor adjustments to the device mounting position or current access method settings may be carried out during the visit if this can be achieved safely and is within the professional competency of the member of staff carrying out the visit. Such changes should be detailed in the PPM record and escalated according to local procedures as needed.

A number of scenarios may highlight the need for minor changes to the installed system: the user's vocabulary/pageset should be under regular review by the local team and should be kept up to date by them, however a PPM visit may prompt reflection on the existing set up and trigger review of the package that is being used and/ or the supported features that have been enabled for the user \(e.g. Internet, Email, SMS, ECS\); there may be occasions where it is clear that the patient will benefit from some adjustment to their current access method settings \(e.g. scan rate, acceptance time, dwell time\) due to some change in their skills; minor adjustments to the current device mounting position may also be requested or identified.

A record should be made both of the original settings and new settings; training should be provided so that the local team understand the reason for these changes; and the changes should be recorded in the PPM record, the client notes and discussed/escalated within the team on return. If the device is mounted to a wheelchair, the  device should only be moved if the modified position has either a neutral or positive impact on the stability of the system, unless a stability test can be carried out at the visit.

Please refer to the PPM Checklist for an example checklist that includes repairs and modifications.
