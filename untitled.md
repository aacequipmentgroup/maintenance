# Resources

A range of resources are required to be able to effectively carry out PPM.

## Information and Systems

An appropriate equipment management system should be in place that allows, as a minimum, the service to:

1. Inventory the equipment installed with each client.
2. Show the version of the equipment currently in use and whether it has been upgraded, modified or repaired since it was supplied.  
3. Allow allocation of a PPM period to each item or group of items.
4. Reported faults, repairs or known defects with the device.
5. Manufacturer user manuals.

A system should be in place to ensure that all equipment with allocated PPM schedules is triggered for the PPM to be carried out. There should also be a system of assurance to check PPM has been completed for each client installation and to audit the quality of PPM.

## Equipment Vigilance

Whoever provides maintenance and repair services should ensure that they are automatically alerted of any changes to repair or maintenance instructions and other essential safety information issued by the manufacturer. This system should include all relevant guidance issued by the MHRA, such as Medical Device Alerts. There may be changes to the design, or other information, which could affect safety or change the requirements for repair or maintenance, including recalls/safety measures and mandatory upgrades.

In addition, procedures and systems should be in place for collating other device specific information that may impact on the maintenance of the equipment. This would include, but not be limited to: model specific device faults and repairs collated by the service or 3rd parties; locally produced device or client specific user guides.

## Staffing

The guidance documentation states that staff carrying out repair and maintenance of equipment need to be adequately trained and appropriately qualified. This should be documented in a training record. The specific job role and associated qualifications, registrations and competencies may vary between services however a service must be able to evidence that staff are adequately trained and competent to carry out the role.

Staff registered as Clinical Technologists or Healthcare Science Practitioners should have job roles that are appropriate for carrying out PPM and other aspects of powered communication aid provision and equipment management.  Services should have staff carrying out these roles supervised by a registered Clinical Technologist, Clinical Scientist or someone who can demonstrate their competence to do so.

The standards of proficiency for Clinical Technologists \(a role which requires a Level 6 qualification\) should, as a minimum, provide a reference point for the development of job role specific competencies for any field service based role. A field-based PPM role would require, as a minimum, a relevant technical qualification at Level 4 or someone who can demonstrate equivalent competence. All staff carrying out PPM will be carrying out direct work with clients and so should be cleared through Enhanced DBS checks. Some relevant National Occupations Standards exist that are relevant to this role, including: Test medical devices, products, equipment and associated systems within healthcare \(CHS207\); Maintain healthcare equipment, medical devices and associated systems \(CHS210\) ; Repair medical devices, equipment and associated systems within healthcare \(CHS208 \).

It is expected that training records for all staff carrying out PPM would include documentation of training on equipment PPM procedures; as well as specific aspects/competencies of the PPM role. These records would evidence that training, where not accredited, was delivered by a competent individual and each record should include evidence of assessment and be signed off by a supervisor.  Training should include Portable Appliance Testing \(e.g. City & Guilds 2377-22\).

## Organisational Resources

Other resources that may be appropriate in delivering an effective PPM service would include:

1. Appropriate test equipment - I.e. a PAT tester and a calibrated Medical Grade Electrical Safety tester.
2. A Medical Electronics department or other source of consultation and oversight related to medical device maintenance and management.
3. The ability to fault find and repair electronic equipment found faulty at PPM.
