## Executive Summary

This document was produced by the NHS England Clinical Reference Group for Disability and Rehabilitation, Augmentative and Alternative Communication \(AAC\) Advisory Group, Equipment Working Party. The intention of this document is to act as a guide for services providing specialised powered communication aids in how to effectively proactively manage these devices – a process known as planned preventative maintenance \(PPM\).

{% hint style="info" %}
 This document does not cover other aspects of a device’s life cycle such as commissioning, decommissioning or reactive servicing. 
{% endhint %}

This guide firstly covers the background to PPM including a review of the relevant legislation; it then covers factors suggested as important in the setting up of a PPM schedule for this equipment;  finally it covers the suggested components of a PPM procedure.  An Appendix is included with a corresponding PPM checklist that could be used as a template for carrying out PPM activities.
