# Preparation and Booking

Advance preparation will ensure that the PPM visits are effective and efficient. Preparation will include checking the inventory and then checking for any appropriate equipment, site or client specific information. Appropriate tools, software, configurations and other resources will be put in place for the PPM visits being prepared for. The normal local procedures will determine the practicalities of booking a visit, but these should include a procedure for escalation when a client cannot be contacted to arrange the PPM visit.
