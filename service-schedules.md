# Service Schedules

Managing Medical Devices states that:

> The frequency and type of planned preventive maintenance should be specified, in line with the manufacturer’s instructions and taking account of the expected usage and the environment in which it is to be used.

A number of factors should thus be considered in considering the appropriate PPM period. These will include:

1. Manufacturer's Instructions – the instructions from the manufacture should be checked to see if there is any reference to PPM. If any clarification is required, the manufacturer could be contacted directly or by requesting a Pre-Purchase Questionnaire \(PPQ\) for the product \(e.g. via the NHS Supply Chain Framework Contract\).
2. Device Specific Requirements – these may determine a maximum maintenance interval \(such as battery life and replacement\).
3. Client Specific Requirements  – if the device is used heavily, perhaps through forceful access or previous hardware faults, more frequent inspections may be required.
4. Environment Specific Requirements – such as potential involvement of those around the individual or challenging environmental conditions \(e.g. where third parties may be able to interfere with the equipment; where the equipment is wheelchair mounted; where there has been previous damage to housings or cables; or where a client is regularly outdoors\).

Each of these factors represents a specific risk consideration that will be reviewed when setting a PPM period/schedule. It is expected that these considerations would be part of a risk evaluation and assessment policy and local procedure. If an initial risk evaluation highlights any specific areas of concern then a risk assessment of each individual risk would support the planning of any mitigations – which may include a specific PPM schedule. Risk evaluation and assessment will occur at a number of times in the process of assessing for and providing powered communication aids and the process around this is out of scope of this guidance.

One reason for PPM is to reduce risks presented by an installation \(I.e. a communication aid placed in-situ with a client\). PPM will not always be put in place to mitigate a specific identified residual risk, however in all cases it is suggested that a risk evaluation should inform decisions around what the appropriate PPM schedule is.

As well as the factors above, it would be expected that a PPM risk evaluation would also consider specific:

1. Mechanical Safety Considerations – e.g. wheelchair mounting.
2. Electrical Safety Considerations – e.g. patient applied parts.
3. Device Considerations - e.g. previous repairs or faults with this particular device.
4. Transportation Considerations - e.g. where the device is moved on a wheelchair, or transported by a carer, or in a vehicle. 
5. Integration Considerations –  e.g. wheelchair integration or computer access.

Services may have in place a default PPM period for cases where no other factors highlight the need for a specific PPM schedule or period. In these cases however it would still be expected that a service could evidence that this is consistent with manufacturer's instructions and the anticipated usage and environment.

Considering the guidance in the existing documents referenced earlier in this guidance, and the risk factors identified above, one of the following inspection schedules could be considered:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Typical Use" %}
| Visual Inspection | Combined Inspection and Test |
| --- | --- |
| 2 years | Not required |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Heavy Use or High Risk" %}
| Visual Inspection | Combined Inspection and Test |
| --- | --- |
| 6 months | 1 year |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
